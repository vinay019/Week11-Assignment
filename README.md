## Project description:

An app that helps the user breakdown tasks into smaller manageable chunks of tasks with a recommended set of pomodoro sessions. The app also provides a pomodor timer for the user to use.

## Problem domain:

Providing a platform for those overwhelmed with large or complex tasks by helping breaking them into smaller manageable chunks of tasks.

## User stories:

🐿️ As a Developer, I should have well-organised code containing a client app folder, so that I can deploy my code separately

🐿️ As a Developer, I should have well organised code containing a server app folder, so that I can deploy my code separately

🐿️ As a Developer, I should keep my API key secret, so that other developers don’t steal my paid-for API access.

🐿️ As a User, I should be able to interact with the client page to send a prompt to an AI tool, and also see a response back from that AI tool, so that I can enjoy the application.

## Stretch User Stories

🐿️ As a Developer, I have used my knowledge of prompt engineering and included it in the prompt sent to the API, so that I can get a better response from the LLM.

🐿️ As a User, I can interact with another part of the app which uses data from a different API, so that I get a richer experience.

🐿️ As a Developer, I have created and utilised a synthetic dataset which gets given to the LLM, for a better response.

🐿️ As a Designer, I have implemented design principles into this application, so that the user has a well thought out experience and an easier time using the app.

🐿️ As a Marketer, I have implemented my knowledge about brand/brand guidelines/customer personas/other marketing fundamentals, to tailor this app to a specific audience.

## Reflections:

### 🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I've achieved all the base requirements and a couple of stretch goal requirements.

### 🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

N.A.

### 🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

N.A.

### What went really well and what could have gone better?

The app has come out better than expected with the help and guidance from ChatGPT.

### Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials):

Used ChatGPT provided code to help with the checklists, the celebration feature once all the checklists are completed and also the pomodoro timer. I also used Chat GPT's guidance for styling initially for the MVP which was just breaking down the task into smaller tasks through Google gemini API.
